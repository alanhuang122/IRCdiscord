ircdiscord
----------

Build command: go build

Run the resulting binary and connect to the IRC server (by default,
127.0.0.1:6667) with the server password <discord token>:<discord server id>
(without the angle brackets).

Note that HexChat silently truncates server passwords and is currently not
supported.

Multiple simultaneous connections are supported, and will share the
same Discord websocket connection.

IRC channel: #ircdiscord on freenode
